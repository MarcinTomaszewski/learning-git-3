			<h1>Little Things</h1>
			<h2>Abbey Glover</h2>
			<p>The branches on the trees are swaying
				Reminded me of when we were dancing
				Last night in your room music blasting
				To 80s music and you were singing
			</p>
			<p>It's the little things with you the simple things that we do that I Love, that I love the most.
				Like pillow fights late at night and arguing cos you think you're always right, these are the things that I love the most.
