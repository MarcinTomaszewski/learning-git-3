			<p class="main__text">The branches on the trees are swaying
				Reminded me of when we were dancing
				Last night in your room music blasting
				To 80s music and you were singing
			</p>
			<p class="main__text">It's the little things with you the simple things that we do that I Love, that I love the most.
				Like pillow fights late at night and arguing cos you think you're always right, these are the things that I love the most.
			</p>
			<p class="main__text">Waking up to your beautiful face
				Is a feeling that I could never replace 
				With anyone, anyone other than you.
				We could sit for hours and hours not saying a thing
				Sitting there right in front of each over
				Watching me watching you
				Watching me watching you
			</p>

			<h1 class="main__title">Dear Brain</h1>
			<h3 class="main__litte-title">Abbey Glover</h3>
			<p class="main__text">Dear brain, won't you let me sleep tonight ?
				Even just for an hour 
				And I'll probably feel more alright
				Dear brain, I don't mean to be rude
				It's just some night I don't want to 
				Have to deal with you 
			</p>
			<p class="main__text">Dear brain, I'm so tired 
				Can't even close my eyes
				Always open wide
				Dear brain, won't you turn off tonight 
				Let me sleep all through the night 
				Sleep tight
			</p>
			<p class="main__text">Dear brain, I've been awake for such a long long time 
				That I've probably counted all the stars 
				In this stupid night sky
				Dear brain, won't you tell me what's wrong with you 
				How to fix you
			</p>
