			<h1>Little Things</h1>
			<h2>Abbey Glover</h2>
			<p>The branches on the trees are swaying
				Reminded me of when we were dancing
				Last night in your room music blasting
				To 80s music and you were singing
			</p>
			<p>It's the little things with you the simple things that we do that I Love, that I love the most.
				Like pillow fights late at night and arguing cos you think you're always right, these are the things that I love the most.
			</p>
			<p>Waking up to your beautiful face
				Is a feeling that I could never replace 
				With anyone, anyone other than you.
				We could sit for hours and hours not saying a thing
				Sitting there right in front of each over
				Watching me watching you
				Watching me watching you
			</p>
